# ACIT4510 Statistical Learning – Chess Prediction

This repo contains a single, self‑contained project: a Jupyter notebook (`analysis.ipynb`) that predicts the winner of a chess game (white/black/draw) and game length (turns) using only pre/early‑game information (ratings, time control, opening category/ply). 

 To run: `pip install -r requirements.txt`, open `analysis.ipynb`, and “Run All”; figures auto‑save to `Report/figs`.
